=========

    The `heyókȟa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyoka>`__ [...] is a kind of
    sacred clown in the culture of the Sioux (Lakota and Dakota people)
    of the Great Plains of North America. The heyoka is a contrarian, jester,
    and satirist, who speaks, moves and reacts in an opposite fashion to the
    people around them.

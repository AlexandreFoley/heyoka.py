    "# Box control in satellite Formation Flying \n",

This way the event equation takes a simple form. Vector components in this frame will be indicated with the subscripts $x,y,z$, so that for example the disturbance acceleration vector acting on the Chief will be $\\left[d_{C,x}, d_{C,y}, d_{C,z}\\right]$.\n",
